            --== NOUNS ==--

            Nouns are things. In a name, the role of a noun can be taken by a
            nonsense word, a name, or any number of things.

            We create a band name by repeatedly modifying a noun in sundry
            fashions. But how?

            - Add an article
            Simply put "A", "An", or "The" in front of the noun. This also
            breaks the loop, unless a name or verb is added.

            - Add an adjective
            Pull a random adjective from a list and append it to the noun.

            - Add a name
            After the fashion of bands such as Jefferson Airplane or Buffalo
            Springfield, randomly add a first or last name somewhere before or
            after the noun. Or we could create a band name by putting "(name) &
            The" after the noun.

            - Do something
            Put a verb somewhere in the name. The verb may be transitive or in-
            transitive, depending on where it is placed. If the verb is tran-
            sitive, we must add objects or subjects appropriately.

            - Gibberish
            If the first noun is a nonsense word, we can create another nonsense
            word by removing or modifying letters from the first one to create
            a nonsense word that alliterates or rhymes.

            --== ADJECTIVE ==--

            Adjectives modify nouns.

            --== VERBS ==--

            Duh.


            -----===== TODO =====-----
            Add random word generator
            Flesh out name generator with first and last names and verbs

            How are we going to do so many random options for each word type?
            What about if we... y'know...

            -----===== NEVER MIND =====-----
            Maybe using a Markov Chain would be the way to go? It wouldn't link
            between individual words, but between different parts of speech.
            I'm not sure which 'direction' to go in, would we start from the
            front and work onward? Would we start with a noun and go from there,
            both forward and backward?

            I need to start by building a Markov chain test. Each link in the
            chain has a getNext() method that returns a new Markov chain link of
            a different type.
