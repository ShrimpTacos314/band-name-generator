            --== NOUNS ==--

            Nouns are things. In a name, the role of a noun can be taken by a
            nonsense word, a name, or any number of things.

            We create a band name by repeatedly modifying a noun in sundry
            fashions. But how?

            - Add an article
            Simply put "A", "An", or "The" in front of the noun. This also
            breaks the loop, unless a name or verb is added.

            - Add an adjective
            Pull a random adjective from a list and append it to the noun.

            - Add a name
            After the fashion of bands such as Jefferson Airplane or Buffalo
            Springfield, randomly add a first or last name somewhere before or
            after the noun. Or we could create a band name by putting "(name) &
            The" after the noun.

            - Do something
            Put a verb somewhere in the name. The verb may be transitive or in-
            transitive, depending on where it is placed. If the verb is tran-
            sitive, we must add objects or subjects appropriately.

            - Gibberish
            If the first noun is a nonsense word, we can create another nonsense
            word by removing or modifying letters from the first one to create
            a nonsense word that alliterates or rhymes.

            --== ADJECTIVE ==--

            Adjectives modify nouns.

            --== VERBS ==--

            Duh.
